## RDS Overview

- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

### Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

- RDS is a managed service:
  - Automated provisioning, OS patching
  - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Read replicas for improved read performance
  - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance windows for upgrades
  - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- BUT you can’t SSH into your instances

### RDS - Storage Auto Scaling

- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
- Automatically modify storage if:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
- Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)

### RDS Read Replicas for read scalability

- Up to 5 Read Replicas
- Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

#### Read Replicas - Use Cases
  
- You have a production database that is taking on normal load
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- The production application is unaffected
- Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

#### Read Replicas - Network Cost

- In AWS there’s a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don’t pay that fee

### RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)

- SYNC replication
- One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
- Increase availability
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling
- Multi-AZ replication is free
- Note:The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)

#### RDS - From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ

- Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
- Just click on “modify” for the database
- The following happens internally:
  - A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  - Synchronization is established between the two databases

| Read Replicas                       | Multi-AZ                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Scale the read workload of your DB  | Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability) |
| Can create up to 5 Read Replicas    | Data is only read/written to the main database    |
| Data is only written to the main DB | Can only have 1 other AZ as failover              |

## RDS Custom

- Managed Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server Database with OS and database customization
- RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of database in AWS
- Custom: access to the underlying database and OS so you can
  - Configure settings
  - Install patches
  - Enable native features
  - Access the underlying EC2 Instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
- De-activate Automation Mode to perform your customization, better to take a DB snapshot before
- RDS vs. RDS Custom
  - RDS: entire database and the OS to be managed by AWS
  - RDS Custom: full admin access to the underlying OS and the database
